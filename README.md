# Bootcamp-week-1-project
This is my week 1 project for the lux data science bootcamp
It was an assignment on a weather data set done on jupyter notebook
the dataset was obtained from kaggle
I used the numpy and pandas module to do the following;
  -list the top 10 rows, last 10 rows, the total number of columns and rows in the dataset.
  -Find all records where the weather was exactly clear.
  -Find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr.
  -Check if there are any NULL values present in the dataset.
  -Rename the column "Weather" to "Weather_Condition."
  -What is the mean visibility of the dataset?
  -Find the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km.
  -What is the mean value of each column for each weather condition?
  -Find all instances where the weather is clear and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40.
  -Find the number of weather conditions that include snow.
I also used SQL to answer 4 questions among these which are;
  -Find all records where the weather was exactly clear.
  -Find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr.
  -What is the mean visibility of the dataset?
  -Find the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km.
